-------

NVorbis is a .Net library for decoding Xiph.org Vorbis files. It is designed to run in partial trust environments and does not require P/Invoke or unsafe code. It is built for .Net Standard 2.0 and .Net Framework 4.5.

This implementation is based on the Vorbis specification found on xiph.org. The MDCT and Huffman codeword generator were borrowed from public domain implementations in https://github.com/nothings/stb/blob/master/stb_vorbis.c.

To use:

```cs
// add a reference to NVorbis.dll

// this is the simplest usage; see the public classes and constructors for other options
using (var vorbis = new NVorbis.VorbisReader("path/to/file.ogg"))
{
	// get the channels & sample rate
    var channels = vorbis.Channels;
    var sampleRate = vorbis.SampleRate;

    // OPTIONALLY: get a TimeSpan indicating the total length of the Vorbis stream
    var totalTime = vorbis.TotalTime;

	// create a buffer for reading samples
    var readBuffer = new float[channels * sampleRate / 5];	// 200ms

	// get the initial position (obviously the start)
    var position = TimeSpan.Zero;

    // go grab samples
    int cnt;
    while ((cnt = vorbis.ReadSamples(readBuffer, 0, readBuffer.Length)) > 0)
    {
    	// do stuff with the buffer
    	// samples are interleaved (chan0, chan1, chan0, chan1, etc.)
    	// sample value range is -0.99999994f to 0.99999994f unless vorbis.ClipSamples == false
    
    	// OPTIONALLY: get the position we just read through to...
        position = vorbis.TimePosition;
    }
}
```
